# Chatbot WA by Yeheskiel Yunus Tame

This is a chatbot system built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Overview

The Chatbot WA system is designed to provide automated responses and interactions for WhatsApp users. It leverages modern web technologies to ensure a seamless and efficient experience. The chatbot can handle various tasks such as answering frequently asked questions, providing information, and assisting users with specific workflows.

## Features

- **Automated Responses**: Quickly respond to user queries with predefined answers.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Tailor the chatbot's behavior to suit your specific needs.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Engage with users in real-time through WhatsApp.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Next.js for performance and scalability.

## Getting Started

To run the chatbot system locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the chatbot interface.

3. Begin editing the chatbot logic by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The application will auto-update as you make changes.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Configure the chatbot's settings and workflows in the project files.
2. **Deploy**: Deploy the chatbot to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel) for production use.
3. **Integrate with WhatsApp**: Connect the chatbot to your WhatsApp account using a third-party API or service.
4. **Interact**: Start using the chatbot to communicate with users and handle their queries.
